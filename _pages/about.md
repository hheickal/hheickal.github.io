I am a MS/PhD student at UMass Amherst. I am interested to work on artificial intelligence systems to fascilitate and enhance educational outcomes for students. I come from Bangladesh, which is one of the most populous country in the world. Due to lack of resources, students suffer a lot in education. My vision is to build effective technological solutions which would enable students to learn and achieve excellence.
